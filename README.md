# Kafka Installation:

## Download a Kafka binary (e.g., Scala 2.12 or 2.13) from the official site.
## Extract the downloaded file and navigate to the Kafka folder in an administrative PowerShell.
## Start Zookeeper and Kafka servers using specified commands.

# Setting Up Microservices:

## Utilise Spring Initializr to create two microservices with dependencies on Spring Web and Kafka.
## Configure properties for Kafka consumers, including spring.kafka.consumer.group-id to define the consumer group.

# Key Concepts:

## @KafkaListener Annotation: Marks methods for message consumption from Kafka topics.
## Topics Attribute: Specifies the Kafka topic to listen to, with values resolved at runtime.
## Consumer Group: A set of consumers sharing the same group ID to balance message processing load.

# Kafka Behaviour:

## Load Balancing: Kafka assigns partitions to consumers within the same group, allowing parallel processing.
## Offset Management: Kafka tracks message offsets for fault tolerance and high availability. Each consumer group maintains its offsets, enabling recovery and scalability.

# Temporary Directory and Offsets:

## The __consumer_offsets internal topic stores offsets for consumer groups, aiding in message processing continuity.
## The recovery-point-offset-checkpoint file is used for tracking last successful offsets, ensuring integrity during recovery.
Overall, the content outlines the practical steps for installing Kafka, creating microservices with Spring Boot, and understanding the critical concepts of message consumption and offset management in Kafka.
